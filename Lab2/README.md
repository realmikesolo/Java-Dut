# Java Laboratory Work â„–2: Library Management System

## Overview

This Java project is a simple Library Management System that allows librarians to manage items (books, DVDs) and patrons (clients) of a library. The system is designed to handle basic library operations such as adding and removing items, registering patrons, lending and returning items, as well as displaying lists of available and borrowed items.
